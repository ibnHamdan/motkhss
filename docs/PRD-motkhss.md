# PRD: Motkhss

Motkhss is a social web app for finding volunteers and sharing  volunteer opportunities in a
hackernews-style experience. It allows users to post links to ooportunities, videos,
channels, or other public resources on the web, and other users to vote and
comment on those resources.

# Experience

## Opportunities list

The site's landing page is a list of links, each link showing up with a title
that was given to it by the a user. Links are also given scores based on their
popularity and age, and are sorted as such.

Without signing in, users are able to browse this list and navigate to the
posted links. After signing in, users can also add comments to a Opportunity, upvote a
Opportunities, or add and delete their own opportunity.

## Tagging

An Opportunity can have a set of tags to describe its different attributes, usually
related to its topic. A special tag is added for the Opportunity's language (e.g.
Arabic), and users can filter the experience using those tags.

## Comments

Comments are sorted reverse-chronologically for any given Opportynity. Users are able
to delete their own comments.

# Market

This is a hybrid experience between news sites such as Hackernews or Reddit .
